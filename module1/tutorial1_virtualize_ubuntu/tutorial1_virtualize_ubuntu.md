# ROS Workshop - Tutorial 1 - Virtualize Ubuntu

## Overview

In this tutorial you will first download and install VirtualBox from Oracle which is an application for _virtualizing_ operating systems inside of an existing one. Next, you will download the Ubuntu installation .iso file and setup a virtual operating system for learning ROS.  After completing this exercise, you will be ready to install the ROS Melodic software package in Ubuntu which is described in detailed in the next module.

## What is a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine}{Virtual Machine) ?
- A virtual machine is an operating system that is installed or _virtualized_ inside another operating system.
- This is useful for learning and testing, but it is resource intensive and is not ideal for permanent use. 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is a trusted application from Oracle widely used for this process. [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/) is alternative option for virtualization, but it will not be supported in this course.

# ros_workshop
This is a collection of lectures for the ROS workshop for ME4140, Introduction to Robotics

I am preparing the ROS workshop to run in the Fall 2020 at Tennessee Technological University

It shouldnt be too bad... It will be easy !

### Things to do:

- [ ] put it on the github, write this readme!
- [x] plan weekly schedule, what goes in what weeks
- [x] thoroughly test all modul
- [ ] convert all PDFs to readme files so the github stands alone

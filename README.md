# ros_lectures
This is a collection of lectures for the ROS workshop for ME4140, Introduction to Robotics

I am preparing the ROS workshop to run in the Fall 2020 at Tennessee Technological University

It shouldnt be too bad... It will be easy !

	Things to do:
	
		0) put it on the github, write this readme!
		1) Plan out the weekly schedule, what goes in what weeks
		2) test the stuff
		3) convert all PDFs to readme files so the github stands alone
